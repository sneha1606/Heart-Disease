# Heart-Disease

Introduction: 

*The below mentioned project has been completed for a case study competition by IIT-Roorkee*

Problem Statement:
The goal is to predict the rate of heart disease (per 100,000 individuals) across the United States at the county-level from other socioeconomic indicators. The data is compiled from a wide range of sources .
There are 33 variables in this dataset. Each row in the dataset represents a United States county, and the dataset we are working with covers two particular years, denoted a, and b We don't provide a unique identifier for an individual county, just a row_id for each row.
The variables in the dataset have names that of the form category__variable, where category is the high level category of the variable (e.g. econ or health). variable is what the specific column contains. Both training and test dataset are from same population. 
We're trying to predict the variable heart_disease_mortality_per_100k (a positive integer), for each row of the test data set.
